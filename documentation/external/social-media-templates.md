### r/ArtificialIntelligence - Technical Focus
**Title:** How to Extend Claude Code with Custom Skills, Agents, and Automation

**Body:**
```
For developers using Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant), I've written a comprehensive guide on extending it with custom capabilities.

**The augmentation approach:**

1. **Skills** - Autonomous background helpers that activate automatically
   - code-reviewer (real-time quality checks)
   - security-auditor (OWASP Top 10 scanning)
   - test-generator (auto-suggest missing tests)

2. **Agents** - Specialized sub-agents for deep analysis
   - @code-reviewer (comprehensive code review)
   - @architect (system design decisions)
   - @performance-tuner (optimization analysis)

3. **Commands** - Workflow orchestration tools
   - /scaffold (project generation)
   - /review (automated code review pipeline)
   - /docs-gen (documentation automation)

**Complete guide:** https://gist.github.com/alirezarezvani/a0f6e0a984d4a4adc4842bbe124c5935

The guide includes installation instructions, FAQs, troubleshooting, and real-world use cases. All tools are open source (MIT).

### r/programming - Developer Focus
**Title:** [Guide] Supercharge Claude Code with Skills, Agents, and Slash Commands

**Body:**
```
I've documented a complete ecosystem for extending Claude Code with custom capabilities - think VS Code extensions but for AI assistants.

**Quick overview:**

**8 Autonomous Skills** (work automatically):
- Code reviewer, security auditor, test generator, secret scanner, API documenter

**8 Expert Agents** (invoke manually):
- @code-reviewer, @architect, @debugger, @performance-tuner, @refactor-expert

**4 Workflow Commands**:
- /scaffold (generate projects/components)
- /review (automated code review)
- /test-gen (create test suites)
- /docs-gen (documentation generation)

**The ecosystem includes:**
- **Tresor** - Ready-to-use utilities (install in < 2 min)
- **Skill Factory** - Build custom skills for your tech stack
- **Skills Library** - 26+ pre-built domain packages

**Full guide:** https://gist.github.com/alirezarezvani/a0f6e0a984d4a4adc4842bbe124c5935

**Optional Comment:**
```
I've been working with Claude Code for the past few months and built out an ecosystem of augmentation tools. This guide covers:

- How to add autonomous skills that work in the background (code review, security scanning, test generation)
- Specialized agents for deep analysis (architecture, debugging, performance tuning)
- Workflow commands for automation (scaffolding, testing, documentation)

There are 3 repositories that work together:
1. Claude Code Tresor - ready-to-use utilities (what most people start with)
2. Skill Factory - build custom skills for your specific needs
3. Skills Library - 26+ pre-built packages for different roles (marketing, product, engineering)

The guide has 20+ FAQs, 5 detailed use cases with code, and step-by-step installation. All MIT licensed.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or specific use cases!
