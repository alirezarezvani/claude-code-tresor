**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Dig deeper than surface-level complaints to identify underlying systemic issues
- Distinguish between symptoms and root causes of customer friction
- Analyze the interconnections between different friction points
- Identify whether issues stem from product design, process gaps, communication failures, or expectation mismatches

2. **Thematic Analysis**: Use systematic coding to identify patterns and themes
3. **Journey Mapping**: Plot friction points against customer journey stages
4. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate business impact and customer satisfaction effects
5. **Solution Framework**: Develop prioritized recommendations with implementation guidance

**Quality Standards:**
- Base all conclusions on solid evidence from the data provided
- Distinguish between correlation and causation in your analysis
- Acknowledge limitations in data or methodology
- Provide confidence intervals or uncertainty ranges where appropriate
- Cross-reference findings across multiple data sources when available

**Output Format:**
- Lead with executive summary of key findings and recommendations
- Provide detailed analysis organized by friction point or journey stage
