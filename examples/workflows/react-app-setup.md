# React Application Setup Workflow ðŸš€

Complete workflow for setting up a modern React application with TypeScript, testing, and best practices using Claude Code utilities.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

- **Purpose**: Demonstrate complete React app setup from scratch
- **Technologies**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Jest, Testing Library
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- **Skill Level**: Beginner to Intermediate

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build

A production-ready React application with:
- Modern TypeScript configuration
- Component library with Storybook
- Comprehensive testing setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Documentation and deployment

## âœ… Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control
- VS Code or preferred editor
- Claude Code CLI configured

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Project Initialization

Create a new React project with TypeScript using Claude Code:

```bash
# Use scaffold command to create project structure
/scaffold react-app task-manager --typescript --vite --tailwind --tests

# Expected output: Complete project structure with configuration files
```

**What this creates:**
- Vite-based React app with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest + Testing Library setup
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Basic project structure

### Step 2: Project Setup Verification

Verify the project was created correctly:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd task-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests
npm run test

# Check linting
npm run lint
```

**Expected results:**
- Development server runs on http://localhost:5173
- Tests pass successfully
- No linting errors

### Step 3: Core Components Development

Generate essential components using Claude Code:

```bash
# Create main layout component
/scaffold react-component Layout --typescript --tests --stories
```

Then use a prompt to create more complex components:

```
@docs-writer Create a TaskList component for a task management app with these requirements:

- Display a list of tasks with title, description, status, and due date
- Support task status filtering (all, active, completed)
- Include add new task functionality
- Use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Include accessibility features
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Generate comprehensive tests

Component should handle:
- Task creation with validation

- Loading state during operations

Please include:
1. Main TaskList component
2. Individual TaskItem component
3. AddTaskForm component
4. TypeScript interfaces
5. Unit tests for all components
6. Storybook stories
```

### Step 4: State Management Setup

Use Claude Code to implement state management:

```
