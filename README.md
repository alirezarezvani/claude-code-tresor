## ‚ú® What's Included

### üöÄ Slash Commands (4 Essential)
Transform your development workflow with these powerful commands:

| Command | Purpose | Example Usage |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **`/scaffold`** | Generate project structures, components, and boilerplate | `/scaffold react-component UserProfile --hooks --tests` |
| **`/review`** | Automated code review with security and performance analysis | `/review --scope staged --checks security,performance` |
| **`/test-gen`** | Create comprehensive test suites automatically | `/test-gen --file utils.js --coverage 90` |
| **`/docs-gen`** | Generate documentation from code and comments | `/docs-gen api --format openapi` |

### ü§ñ Specialized Agents (8 Expert)
Expert-level assistance for complex development tasks:

| Agent | Expertise | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **`@code-reviewer`** | Code quality, security, performance analysis | PR reviews, code audits, best practices |
| **`@test-engineer`** | Testing strategies, test creation, QA | Unit tests, integration tests, coverage analysis |
| **`@docs-writer`** | Technical documentation, user guides | API docs, README files, troubleshooting guides |
| **`@architect`** | System design, technology evaluation | Architecture reviews, design decisions |
| **`@debugger`** | Root cause analysis, troubleshooting | Production issues, complex bugs |
| **`@security-auditor`** | Security assessment, OWASP compliance | Security audits, vulnerability analysis |
| **`@performance-tuner`** | Performance optimization, profiling | Performance issues, bottleneck analysis |
| **`@refactor-expert`** | Code refactoring, clean architecture | Technical debt, code modernization |

### ‚ú® Skills (8 Autonomous) - **NEW!**
Automatic background helpers that work while you code:

| Skill | What It Does | Triggers On |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **`code-reviewer`** | Real-time code quality checks | File edits, saves |
| **`test-generator`** | Suggests missing tests automatically | New functions, untested code |
| **`git-commit-helper`** | Generates commit messages from diff | `git diff --staged` |
| **`security-auditor`** | Detects vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS) | Auth code, API endpoints |
| **`secret-scanner`** | Blocks commits with exposed secrets | Pre-commit, API keys in code |
| **`dependency-auditor`** | Checks dependencies for CVEs | package.json changes |
| **`api-documenter`** | Auto-generates OpenAPI specs | API routes added |
| **`readme-updater`** | Keeps README current | Project changes, features |

**Skills vs Agents:** Skills work **automatically** in the background. Agents require **manual invocation** (`@agent`) for deep analysis.
