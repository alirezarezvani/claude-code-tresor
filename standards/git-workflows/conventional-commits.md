# Conventional Commits Standard üìù

A specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages, enabling automated versioning, changelog generation, and better collaboration.

## üéØ Overview

Conventional Commits provide:
- **Structured History**: Clear, searchable commit history
- **Automated Tools**: Enables automated versioning and changelog generation
- **Clear Communication**: Describes the nature and impact of changes
- **Better Collaboration**: Makes it easier for team members to understand changes
- **Release Management**: Facilitates semantic versioning and automated releases

## üìè Commit Message Format

### Basic Structure
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples
```bash
# Simple commit
feat: add user authentication

# With scope
feat(auth): add JWT token validation

# With body and footer
feat(api): add user registration endpoint

Implement POST /api/auth/register endpoint with email validation,
password hashing, and user creation. Includes comprehensive error
handling and input sanitization.

Closes #123
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Commit Types

### Primary Types

#### `feat` - New Features
```bash
# Adding new functionality
feat: add dark mode toggle

style: fix eslint warnings
style(components): improve code formatting
style: add missing semicolons
```

#### `refactor` - Code Refactoring
```bash
# Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features

```

## üéØ Scopes

### Purpose
Scopes provide additional context about which part of the codebase is affected.

### Common Scopes

#### Frontend Scopes
```bash
feat(ui): add loading spinner component
fix(components): resolve prop validation warnings
style(layout): improve responsive grid system
```

feat(auth): implement OAuth2 integration
fix(payment): resolve checkout calculation errors
test(notifications): add email delivery tests
```

#### Infrastructure Scopes
```bash
chore(docker): update base image to node:18
ci(deploy): add staging environment workflow
build(webpack): configure code splitting
```

### Scope Guidelines
- **Be Consistent**: Use the same scopes across your team
- **Be Specific**: Choose the most relevant scope
- **Keep It Short**: Use abbreviations when appropriate
- **Document Scopes**: Maintain a list of accepted scopes

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Effective Descriptions

### Description Guidelines
- **Use imperative mood**: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- **Keep it concise**: 50 characters or less when possible
- **Start lowercase**: Unless it's a proper noun
- **No period**: Don't end with a period
- **Be descriptive**: Explain what the change does, not how

### Good Examples
```bash
# ‚úÖ Clear and concise
feat: add user profile photo upload
fix: resolve race condition in async data loading
docs: update installation guide for Windows
refactor: extract validation logic to separate module

# ‚úÖ Good use of scope
feat(auth): implement password reset functionality
fix(mobile): correct touch event handling on iOS
perf(api): cache frequently accessed user data
```

### Poor Examples
```bash
# ‚ùå Vague descriptions
feat: add stuff
fix: bug fix
chore: updates

# ‚ùå Wrong tense or format
feat: adding new feature
fix: fixed the bug.
docs: Updated README

# ‚ùå Too verbose for description line
feat: add comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens and password hashing
```

## üìù Body and Footer Guidelines

### Body Guidelines
- **Use when needed**: Add body for complex changes
- **Explain why**: Focus on motivation and impact
- **Wrap at 72 characters**: For better readability
- **Separate from description**: Use blank line

```bash
feat(api): add user subscription management

Implement comprehensive subscription system including:
- Monthly and annual billing cycles
- Automatic renewal with grace period
- Webhook integration for payment processing
- Admin panel for subscription management

The system supports multiple payment providers and
includes comprehensive error handling for failed
payments and edge cases.
```

### Footer Guidelines
- **Reference issues**: Link to GitHub issues or tickets
- **Breaking changes**: Clearly mark breaking changes
- **Co-authors**: Credit contributors

```bash
# Issue references
Closes #123
Fixes #456
Resolves #789
See #321

# Breaking changes
BREAKING CHANGE: remove support for Node.js 14

The minimum supported Node.js version is now 16.14.0 due to
dependencies requiring newer JavaScript features.

# Co-authors
Co-authored-by: John Doe <john@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Jane Smith <jane@example.com>
```

## üö® Breaking Changes

### Marking Breaking Changes
```bash
# In the type/scope
feat!: remove deprecated user API endpoints
fix(api)!: change response format for user data

# In the footer
feat(auth): add new authentication system

BREAKING CHANGE: replace session-based auth with JWT tokens

All existing authentication endpoints have been removed.

## üéØ Best Practices

### Commit Frequency
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Logical, atomic commits
feat: add user registration form
test: add validation tests for user registration
docs: update API documentation for registration

# ‚ùå Bad: Large, mixed commits
feat: add user system with registration, login, profile, and admin panel
```

### Commit Size
- **Make atomic commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Keep commits focused**: Single responsibility principle
- **Test between commits**: Each commit should leave the code in a working state

### Message Quality
```bash
# ‚úÖ Excellent: Clear, specific, helpful
feat(auth): add password strength validation with configurable rules

# ‚úÖ Good: Clear and specific
fix(ui): resolve button text overflow on mobile devices

# üÜó Acceptable: Basic but clear
feat: add search functionality

# ‚ùå Poor: Vague and unhelpful
fix: bug fix
chore: update stuff
```

## üöÄ Advanced Patterns

### Multi-part Features
```bash
# When implementing a large feature across multiple commits
feat(auth): add authentication database schema
feat(auth): implement user registration API
feat(auth): add login endpoint with JWT tokens
test(auth): add comprehensive authentication tests
docs(auth): document new authentication system
```

### Dependency Updates
```bash
# Regular dependency updates
chore(deps): update lodash to version 4.17.21
chore(deps-dev): update jest to version 29.0.0

# Security updates
fix(deps): update vulnerable packages
chore(deps): bump axios from 0.21.1 to 0.24.0 for security fix
```

### Hotfixes
```bash
# Production hotfixes
fix: resolve critical payment processing error

Critical bug causing payment failures in production.
Applied immediate fix to prevent further issues.

Fixes #URGENT-123
```

## üìö Team Guidelines

### Onboarding New Team Members
1. **Training**: Explain conventional commit benefits and structure
2. **Tools**: Set up commitizen and commitlint
3. **Practice**: Review commit history together
4. **Templates**: Provide commit message templates
5. **Review**: Include commit message quality in code reviews

### Code Review Integration
```markdown
# PR Review Checklist
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Each commit represents a logical change
- [ ] Breaking changes are properly marked
- [ ] Commit descriptions are clear and helpful
- [ ] Related issues are referenced in footers
```

### Enforcement Levels
- **Soft**: Guidelines and recommendations
- **Medium**: Automated checks with warnings
- **Strict**: Build fails on non-compliant commits

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Commit Message Too Long
```bash
# ‚ùå Problem: Description too long
feat: add comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing, email verification, and social login

# ‚úÖ Solution: Use body for details
feat(auth): add comprehensive user authentication system

Implement full authentication system including:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Email verification workflow
- Social login integration (Google, GitHub)
```

#### Wrong Commit Type
```bash
# ‚ùå Problem: Wrong type
docs: fix user registration validation bug

# ‚úÖ Solution: Correct type
fix: resolve user registration validation bug
```

#### Missing Breaking Change Marker
```bash
# ‚ùå Problem: Breaking change not marked
feat(api): change user endpoint response format

# ‚úÖ Solution: Mark breaking change
feat(api)!: change user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: user endpoint now returns different response structure
```
